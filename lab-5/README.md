This is a 2 weeks lab. Here, you are going to write a server program which is going to talk to the client executable we have provided.

    ece4220lab5 -- This folder has examples and two executables
    ece4220lab5/Lab5_client -- Client program executable for Raspberry Pi
    ece4220lab5/Lab5_client_WS -- Client program executable for Ubuntu work station
    
If you are testing your server code on Raspberry Pi then use "Lab5_client" and if you are running everything on Ubuntu workstation then use the "Lab5_client_WS".

Don't forget to add executable permission to the executable using the command "chmod +x Lab5_client" on terminal.
